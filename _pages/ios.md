Quad Solver is in my (not-so-humble) option the single best application in the App Store for dealing with quadratic equations.

Here's the description I wrote for iTunes:

Quad Solver is the best, full featured iOS application for solving Quadratic Equations and using the quadratic formula. Â It's easy to use, fast, and best of all: it's FREE!
